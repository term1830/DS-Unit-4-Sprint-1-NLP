That means you're ready to combine and practice those skills in a kaggle competition. We we will open with a five minute sprint explaining the competition, and then give you 25 minutes to work. After those twenty five minutes are up, I will give a 5-minute demo an NLP technique that will help you with document classification (*and **maybe** the competition*).\n",
