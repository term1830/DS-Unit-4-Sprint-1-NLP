From the outset,\\nthe efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took\\nthe form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty\\nand genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian\\nactivities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of\\nterror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element\\nof brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass\\nrebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore,\\nwhen the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis\\ndefeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.\\nAlthough the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they\\nwere constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their\\ncountry in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked\\nin this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum\\nin 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on\\nthe local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]\\n\\nFor example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander\\nof the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan: \\n\\n \"They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down \\n  by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a \\n  building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word.\" \\n\\nAs for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:\\n\\n\"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning\\n with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken\\n in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army\\n withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian\\n massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked\\n in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places\\n selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs\\n were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after\\n being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part \\n of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the\\n cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering\\n from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived\\n in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.\\n Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not\\n exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in\\n Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything\\n that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them\\n in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting\\n on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages\\n left behind after their occupation of this area.\"[2]\\n \\nForeign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers\\nwho did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the\\ngenocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war.\\nWhat is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the \\nmassacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]\\n\\nAt the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague\\nDr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars,\\nErzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the\\ncruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities,\\nbut also reveal their goal and true nature.[4]\\n\\n[1] (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), \"Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari\\n    Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat,\" (Istanbul, 1918).

withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the      Sarikamis defeat  Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area  Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy  nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war  However  when they returned to their country in      after the Revolution  Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum in       During this period  Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents     For example  let us look at a report dated    March      which the Commander of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan   They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down by Armenians  even the trees were cut down  and they are like a building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word   As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan   Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction  they were taken in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated  When the Russian army withdrew  a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian massacres and cruelties  they were thrown into wells  they were locked in houses and burned down  they were killed with bayonets and swords  in places selected as butchering spots  their bellies were torn open  their lungs were pulled out  and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act  A very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to  Including women and children  such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum  All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled  everything that the people had has been taken away from them  and we found them in a destitute situation  At the present time  the people are subsisting on some food they obtained  impelled by starvation  from Russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area      Foreign observers who witnessed the events  including Russian Officers who did not desert their lines  submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war  What is most important is that they stated in their reports  the massacres did not happen by chance but were planned      At the end of the war  the German author Dr  Weiss  his Austrian colleague Dr  Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr  Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon  Kars  Erzurum and Batum between April   th and May   th      to record the cruelties  Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities  but also reveal their goal and true nature          The Ottoman State  the Ministry of War    Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid

       "5114  Last week I asked for help in getting an old homemade amp working with\\nmy Sun CD-ROM drive. It turns out that the channel I was testing with\\nwas burned out in the amp. The other channel works fine.\\n\\nSo now I need a new amplifier chip. My local Radio Shack no longer\\ncarries components! The chip is a 12 pin SIP (?) labelled with BA5406\\nand then \"502 515\" below that.\\n\\nDoes anyone have a source?

       "5913  \\n\\nThe theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal/Nazi \\nArmenians of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle. \\nNow, try dealing with the rest of what I wrote.\\n\\nWhat is more, the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been\\nefforts aimed at eradicating a race (the Turks) or aimed at carrying out a\\none-sided feud, instead of being a struggle for liberation. From the outset,\\nthe efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took\\nthe form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty\\nand genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian\\nactivities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of\\nterror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element\\nof brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass\\nrebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore,\\nwhen the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis\\ndefeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.\\nAlthough the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they\\nwere constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their\\ncountry in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked\\nin this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum\\nin 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on\\nthe local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]\\n\\nFor example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander\\nof the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan: \\n\\n \"They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down \\n  by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a \\n  building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word.\" \\n\\nAs for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:\\n\\n\"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning\\n with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken\\n in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army\\n withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian\\n massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked\\n in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places\\n selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs\\n were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after\\n being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part \\n of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the\\n cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering\\n from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived\\n in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.\\n Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not\\n exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in\\n Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything\\n that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them\\n in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting\\n on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages\\n left behind after their occupation of this area.\"[2]\\n \\nForeign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers\\nwho did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the\\ngenocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war.\\nWhat is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the \\nmassacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]\\n\\nAt the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague\\nDr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars,\\nErzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the\\ncruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities,\\nbut also reveal their goal and true nature.[4]\\n\\n[1] (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), \"Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari\\n    Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat,\" (Istanbul, 1918).

       "5114  Last week I asked for help in getting an old homemade amp working with my Sun CD ROM drive  It turns out that the channel I was testing with was burned out in the amp  The other channel works fine  So now I need a new amplifier chip  My local Radio Shack no longer carries components  The chip is a    pin SIP     labelled with BA     and then           below that  Does anyone have a source  Thanks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "5913  The theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal Nazi Armenians of the ASALA SDPA ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  Now  try dealing with the rest of what I wrote  What is more  the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been efforts aimed at eradicating a race  the Turks  or aimed at carrying out a one sided feud  instead of being a struggle for liberation  From the outset  the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder  cruelty and genocide  so that no other interpretation of them is possible  Armenian activities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of terror  and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks  The element of brute force in these activities increased steadily  culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War  Furthermore  when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the      Sarikamis defeat  Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area  Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy  nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war  However  when they returned to their country in      after the Revolution  Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum in       During this period  Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents     For example  let us look at a report dated    March      which the Commander of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan   They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down by Armenians  even the trees were cut down  and they are like a building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word   As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan   Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction  they were taken in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated  When the Russian army withdrew  a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian massacres and cruelties  they were thrown into wells  they were locked in houses and burned down  they were killed with bayonets and swords  in places selected as butchering spots  their bellies were torn open  their lungs were pulled out  and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act  A very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to  Including women and children  such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum  All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled  everything that the people had has been taken away from them  and we found them in a destitute situation  At the present time  the people are subsisting on some food they obtained  impelled by starvation  from Russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area      Foreign observers who witnessed the events  including Russian Officers who did not desert their lines  submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war  What is most important is that they stated in their reports  the massacres did not happen by chance but were planned      At the end of the war  the German author Dr  Weiss  his Austrian colleague Dr  Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr  Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon  Kars  Erzurum and Batum between April   th and May   th      to record the cruelties  Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities  but also reveal their goal and true nature          The Ottoman State  the Ministry of War    Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat    Istanbul         The French version   Documents Relatifs aux Atrocites Commises par les Armeniens sur la Population Musulmane    Istanbul         In the Latin script  H  K  Turkozu  ed    Osmanli ve Sovyet Belgeleriyle Ermeni Mezalimi    Ankara         In addition  Z  Basar  ed    Ermenilerden Gorduklerimiz    Ankara        and  edited by the same author   Ermeniler Hakkinda Makaleler   Derlemeler    Ankara          Askeri Tarih Belgeleri       Vol          December        document numbered            Askeri Tarih Belgeleri        Vol          December        document numbered           From Twerdo Khlebof s report dated    April       quoted in Ermeniler      Vol     p           A  R   Altinay    Iki Komite   Iki Kital    Istanbul         and   Kafkas Yollarinda Hatiralar ve Tahassusler   Istanbul         Serdar Argic  "
